Welcome
This is my first Internship Project. It is based on Data Analysis.
In this project I have used multiple data analysis libraries to perform various data analytic procedures.
I have attached the csv file in which the shopping data is stored which I have used in this project.
This idea behind the project is to learn and imnplement simple and advance data analysis techniques to teach the intern about various aspects of data analysis.
In this project I have made use of various libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
I have attached a project report for in-depth understanding of the project.
Thank You!
